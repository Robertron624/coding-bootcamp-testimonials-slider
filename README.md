## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Even though I have been made some projects with complex layouts, I still struggled and learned a lot from this project. I learned how to proper add backgrounds to sections and played with the `z-index` CSS property and play with some properties that involve
the overflow bars.

### Continued development

I want to keep working in projects that require complex layouts and animations. I want to keep learning how to make my code more efficient and readable.
